### The Amazon Sagemaker provides the following tools:
  - Ground Truth - To label the jobs, datasets, and workforces
  - Notebook - To create Jupyter notebook instances, configure the lifecycle of the notebooks, and attache Git repositories
  - Training - To choose an ML algorithm, define the training jobs, and tune the hyperparameter
  - Inference - To compile and configure the trained models, and endpoints for deployments
  
  
### 1. Why is SageMaker a "fully managed" service?
SageMaker helps to reduce the complexity of building, training and deploying your ML models by offering all these steps on a single platform. SageMaker supports building the ML models with modularity, which means you can reuse a model that you have already built earlier in other projects.

### 2. SageMaker Instances:
  - Amazon SageMaker ML Instance Types - See that an instance type is characterized by a combination of CPU, memory, GPU, GPU memory, and networking capacity.
  - Amazon EC2 Instance Types - To have you know the difference in naming and combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
