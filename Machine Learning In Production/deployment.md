# Deployment of Machine Learning Models:
There are three primary components of deployments. These are -
  > * Explore and process data.</br>
  > * Modeling or model your data.</br>
  > * Deployment or deploy your model.

* **Cloud Computing:** Cloud computing can simply be thought of as transforming an Information Technology (IT) product into a service. With our vacation photos example, we transformed storing photos on an IT product, the flash drive; into storing them using a service, like Google Drive. Using a cloud storage service provides the benefits of making it easier to access and share your vacation photos, because you no longer need the flash drive. 
  * **Why would a business decide to use cloud computing?** Most of the factors related to choosing cloud computing services, instead of developing on-premise IT resources are related to time and cost. The capacity utilization graph below shows how cloud computing compares to traditional infrastructure (on-premise IT resources) in meeting customer demand.

  * **Benefits of Risks Associated with Cloud Computing:**
  
    * **Benifits:** </br>
      **1.** Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs (providing cost reduction).</br>
      **2.** Increased Scalability (providing simplified capacity planning).</br>
      **3.** Increased Availability and Reliability (providing organizational agility).</br>
      
    * **Risks:** </br>
      **1.** (Potential) Increase in Security Vulnerabilities.</br>
      **2.** Reduced Operational Governance Control (over cloud resources).</br>
      **3.** Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers.</br>
      **4.** Multi-regional Compliance and Legal Issues.</br>


#### NOTE:
  - Cloud Computing can be used for any or all parts of the machine learning process.
