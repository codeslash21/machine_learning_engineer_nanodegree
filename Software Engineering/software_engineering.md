# Software Engineering Practices:

Best software engineering practices are follows - 
* Writing clean and modular code
* Writing efficient code
* Code refactoring
* Adding meaningful documentation
* Using version control

## Some Important Terms:

* **PRODUCTION CODE:** software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note this is different from production quality code, which describes code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc., for production. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.
* **CLEAN:** readable, simple, and concise. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.
* **MODULAR:** logically broken up into functions and modules. Also an important characteristic of production quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable. Making your code modular make it easier to -
  - Reuse your code.
  - Write less code.
  - Read your code.
  - Collaborate on your code.
* **MODULE:** a file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.

* **REFACTORING:** restructuring your code to improve its internal structure, without changing its external functionality. This gives you a chance to clean and modularize your program after you've got it working.
  * Reduce workload in long run.
  * Easier to maintain code.
  * Reuse more of your code.
